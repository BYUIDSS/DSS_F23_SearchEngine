seat myself to pen you a few lines. I recieved your Letter at the hands of my brother and was truly glad to<br/>
hear from you, was sorry however to hear of the ill state of your health as also that of your family, but<br/>
how it will soon be improved. Wilford as you are aware is quite unwell, and we feel as <u>you write</u>, much<br/>
anxiety respecting him, as he is about to undertake such a journey. and it seems to me as tho’ I could<br/>
not have him leave us so soon, but then, we know that God has <u>called</u> and said “<u>Go</u>”, and<br/>
shall we worms of the dust say <u>stay</u>' Nay, but let us rather rejoice that he is accounted <u>worthy</u><br/>
to become a messenger from God to the nations of the earth. but still my natural feelings at times<br/>
gain the ascendency and I can hardly reconcile myself to have him leave us. I need not say that<br/>
W. is a brother that I set much by of <u>this</u> you probably are aware. but as [[Asahel Hart Woodruff, b. 1814|Asahel]] is <u>gone</u>, my<br/>
affections return with double force upon Willford. I place confidence in <u>him</u> as I formerly did<br/>
in Asahel, looking to him, as a friend and protector, I hope however I shall not forget that<br/>
my comforts and blessings flow from God, the bountiful giver of all good,</p>

<p>I suppose I shall have to be brief at this time, but I shall write you from time to ti[me] [page torn]<br/>
shall hope to hear from you often, and do give us a particular account of things an[d] [page torn]<br/>
with you, for we shall ever be glad to hear, and also as it respects the situation of the church.<br/>
I would ask no greater blessing than to be permitted to take up my residence with the Saints with the<br/>
Saints at the west, I would be willing to undergo ma[n]y earthly privations. I have felt as tho’ I should<br/>
like it much could I be with you whilst W. is gone his mission, but I suppose it would not be<br/>
considered consistent at present. but I do feel as tho’ I should be permitted e'er long, to stand on<br/>
Mount Zion with the blessed company. pray for me Sister, that I may live in such a manner<br/>
as to be accounted worthy to escape the just judgments of God abroad in the land, and finally<br/>
have a standing given me with the saints of God. I have been quite unwell most of the time since<br/>
W. has been at home and consequently have not received as much pleasure in hearing him converse upon<br/>
this Latter day work, as I otherwise should have done. but we have had a very pleasant with him, and<br/>
shall remember it with much pleasure. the greatest complaint I make is that I have not had scarcely<br/>
any apportunity of conversing with him myself. I hope the Lord will <u>grant</u> that he may have grace<br/>
given him to perform his mission acceptably. that the Lord would be with him and bless him<br/>
continually. grant <u>him</u> with the rest of the company a safe and pleasant journey over the waters<br/>

11th A visit on the [[Herefordshire Beacon, Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire Beacon]] 
which is the South part of [[Malvern Hill, Worcestershire, England|Malvern Hill]]
After having my mind prepared for a lonely walk &amp; medi
tation by reading [[Parley Parker Pratt|P. P. Pratts]] remarks upon the ""eternal duration 
of matter"", I commenced assending this noted hill upon the
south side of it &amp; after arising several hundred feet I came
to the top of an old ancient intrenchment about one mile 
in length reaching round all of this part of the hill &amp; meeting

this congregation what kind of a being is God? <br/>
turn your thoughts in your hearts, &amp; say have any <br/>

this is a question that may occupy your attention<br/>

you have not eternal life, go back &amp; find out <br/>
what kind of a being God is. If I am the man <br/>
that shows you what kind of a being God <br/>
is, then let evry man &amp; woman sit in silence <br/>
and never lift up his hand against me again <br/>
if I do not do it, I will not make any further <br/>
pretentions to inspiration or to be a prophet <br/>

any man for his religion, evry goverment ought <br/>

I am going to inquire after God so that you <br/>
may know God, that persecution may cease <br/>
concerning me. I go back to the beginning to <br/>
show what kind of a being God was. I will <br/>
tell you &amp; hear it O Earth! God who sits <br/>
in <u>yonder</u> <u>heavens</u> is a <u>man</u> <u>like</u> <u>yourselves</u><br/>
That <u>GOD</u> if you were to see him to day that <br/>
holds the worlds you would see him like a <br/>
man in form, like yourselves. Adam was</p>

","to eat drink and sleep &amp; this is all man knows 
about God or his exhistance, except what is given 
by the inspiration of the Almighty. go then to 
the beginning that you may understand. I ask
this congregation what kind of a being is God? 
turn your thoughts in your hearts, &amp; say have any 
of you seen or herd him or communed with him 
this is a question that may occupy your attention
The scriptures inform us that this is eternal life 
to know the ownly wise God &amp; Jesus Christ whome 
He has sent.

 
If any inquire what kind of a 
being God is I would say If you dont know God 
you have not eternal life, go back &amp; find out 
what kind of a being God is. If I am the man 
that shows you what kind of a being God 
is, then let evry man &amp; woman sit in silence 
and never lift up his hand against me again 
if I do not do it, I will not make any further 
pretentions to inspiration or to be a prophet 
I would be like the rest of the world, fals teachers 
&amp; you would want to take my life. But you 
might just as well take the lives of other fals teaches 
as mine if I was fals, But meddle not with 
any man for his religion, evry goverment ought 
to permit evry man to enjoy his religion. I will 
show the world is ^w^rong by showing what God is 
I am going to inquire after God so that you 
may know God, that persecution may cease 
concerning me. I go back to the beginning to 
show what kind of a being God was. I will 
tell you &amp; hear it O Earth! God who sits 
in yonder heavens is a man like yourselves
That GOD if you were to see him to day that

you know the Lord has led the church untill the<br/>

for the Elders to teach the church here after<br/>
which is in relation to Zion. The whole of<br/>
North and South America is Zion, the mountain<br/>
of the Lords House is in the centre of North &amp; South<br/>
America, when the house is done, Baptism font erected<br/>
and finished &amp; the worthy are washed, anointed, endowed<br/>
&amp; ordained kings &amp; priests, which must be done<br/>
in this life, when the place is prepared you must<br/>
go through all the ordinances of the house of the<br/>
Lord so that you who have any dead friends must<br/>
go through all the ordinances for them the same as<br/>
for yourselves; then the Elders are to go through<br/>
all America &amp; build up Churches untill all Zion<br/>
is built up, but not to commence to do this untill<br/>
the Temple is built up here and the Elders endowed<br/>
then go forth &amp; accomplish the work &amp; build up<br/>
stakes in all North and South America. Their<br/>
will be some place ordained for the redeeming<br/>
of the dead I think this place will be the one, so their<br/>
will be gathering fast enough here. President<br/>
Smith lungs failed him and he appointed elder<br/>
[[George Washington Joshua Adams|G. J. Adams]] to occupy the time during the foornoon<br/>
He however remarked that his proclamation<br/>
just made was the greatest ever made as all<br/>
could not come here, but it was necessary that<br/>
enough should come to build up the temple &amp;<br/>
get an endowment so that the work could spread<br/>

Oswego Co NY. whare I was again blessed with the
privilege of taking my Brethren after the flesh by
the hand viz [[Azmon Woodruff, b. 1802|Azmon]] &amp; [[Ozem Thompson Woodruff|Thompson Woodruff]] I had
not seen either of them before for three years I
found cousin [[Eldad Woodruff, b. 1812|Eldad Woodruff]] with them. I found
sumthing of a coldness manifest towards me &amp;
my brethren because of our religion from my Brot
hers household esspecially from [[Elizabeth Norton Hart Woodruff|Elizabeth]] my
Brothers wife. Notwithstanding it was against the
principal of my Brothers family to receieve us
for the night we were permited to sup with them
when one of my former neighbours Mr [[Walter Menter|Walter Menter]]
gave us a place to lay our heads for the night which
we gladly accepted. 2nd Timothy 3rd ch. 3. V. O, scenes of
